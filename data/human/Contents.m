%     coneAbsorbance - Stockman-Sharpe (aka CIE) tabulated cone absorbtance.
%                      In log units.  From T_log10coneabsorbance in PTB,

%     lensDensity -    Lens density obtained from PTB.  Not sure which PTB
%                      lens file was used, but the values are very close to
