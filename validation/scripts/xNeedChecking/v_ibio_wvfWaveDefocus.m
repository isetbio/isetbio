% v_wvfWaveDefocus
%
% Compute for wavelengths different from nominal focus wavelength
%
% The psf should get broader away from the focus wavelength. How much
% broader, I don't know but we can at least verify the qualitative
% behavior, again for the diffaction limited case.
%
% Note from DHB.  The psfs do get broader, and they take on multiple peaks.
% Is this right?  I don't know.
%
% Note from HH: The PSF should start to take on multiple peaks (ringing,
% etc should still be radially symmetric) with change in defocus, so this
% looks right.  At some point defocus will be large enough that you'll run
% into sampling problems.  You could check this by starting with very high
% sampling density and decreasing until just before the point where you
% start to see issues.
