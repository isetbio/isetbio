%% Show how to create a display that models some AO experiments
%
% Description:
%    This tutorial shows how to set up an ISETBio scene that represents a
%    display used in an adaptive optics apparatus. It has various options that 
%    illustrate how different displays might be simulated.  It computes
%    cone isomerizations for a spot against a background.
%
%    In particular note options to vary stimulus spot wavelength, to
%    specify stimulus intensity in terms of conrneal power or radiance of a
%    display, to turn modeling of longitudinal chromatic aberration on or
%    off, and to provide custom specification of paramters such as lens
%    density, macular pigment density, and cone photopigment absorbance.
%    The latter may requires some substantive thought for accurate modeling
%    of what happens out at the near IR wavelengths used in AO experiments.
%    Although standard tables go out to about 830 nm, it is not immediately
%    clear how accurate these tables are at such long wavelengths.
%       
%    This tutorial has not worried much about how realistic these
%    specified powers are, nor whether they are within light safety
%    limits. Nor has it been highly tested.  But the basic operation seems
%    in place
