%% Build up the spatial structure in an optical image

% Pull out the optics
optics = oiGet(oi, 'optics');

%% Select spatial samples and wavelength for plotting

% frequency resolution (highest spatial frequency) by a factor of 4.
fSupport = fSupport * 4;  

% Frequency units are cycles/micron. The spatial frequency support runs
% from -Nyquist:Nyquist. With this support, the Nyquist frequency is
% actually the highest (peak) frequency value. There are two samples per
% Nyquist, so the sample spacing is 1/(2*peakF)
peakF = max(fSupport(:));

%% Calculate the OTF using diffraction limited MTF (dlMTF)
otf = dlMTF(oi, fSupport, thisWave, units);

% Derive the psf from the OTF

clear sSupport

% Calculate the Airy disk

% This is the Airy disk radius, by formula
radius = (2.44 * fNumber * thisWave * 10 ^ -9) / 2 ...
