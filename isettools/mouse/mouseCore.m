function [otf, williamsFactor] = mouseCore(wave, sampleSF, p, D0)
% Compute the mouse OTF. Closely copies Human from humanCore w/ mouse param
%
% Syntax:
%   [otf, williamsFactor] = mouseCore(wave, nWave, sampleSF, p, D0)
%
% Description:
%    {Short: Compute the mouse optical transfer function. This is closely
%    copying the human OTF in humanCore, with mouse parameters.
%    The Williams factor is 1 : we don't use it.}
%
%    The computation of the mouse OTF is performed here. It is placed in
%    this routine to permit compilation. The OTF is computed at wavelengths
%    in wave and at sampleSF spatial frequencies in units of cycles/deg.
%
%    The returned williamsFactor is a general loss of contrast, independent
%    of wavelength, that we apply to bring the data into alignment with
%    mouse optics. That factor comes from empirical measurements out of the
%    Williams' lab.
%
%    This function contains examples of usage inline. To access, type 'edit
%    mouseCore.m' into the Command Window.
%
% Inputs:
%    p              - Numeric. Pupil radius in meters
%    D0             - Numeric. Dioptric power (accomodation), usually ~60
%    sampleSF       - Vector. Spatial frequencies in cycles/deg
%    wave           - Vector. Wavelength in nanometers
%
% Outputs:
%    otf            - Matrix. Optical Transfer function for mouse.
%    williamsFactor - Numeric. Williams factor for mouse is 1.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.

%% Compute the OTF

% power of the unnacommodated eye, at in-focus wavelength (approx 544nm for
% the mouse.)

% We skip the Williams factor. It is typical of the human eye, and so not
% useful for the mouse eye. (TODO: what is it?)
% % There is a typical human OTF scaling we use from the work at Dave
% % Williams' lab. Here is a smooth fit to their data. This was provided by
% % Dave Brainard and could be updated or drawn from the literature in some
% % other way. Perhaps from Ijspeert?
