% Class for macular pigment properties
%
% Syntax:
%   obj = Macular;
%
% Description:
%    The human retina contains a pigment that covers the central (macular)
%    region. This macular pigment passes certain wavelengths of light more
%    than others. The pigment varies in density from central vision, where
%    it is highest, to increasingly peripheral vision.
%
%    This class manages several measures of the macular pigment wavelength
%    properties as a function of macular pigment density. Our understanding
%    of the terminology and best conventions for describing this type of
%    data has evolved over time, and the property names differ somewhat
%    from the conventions we would adopt today. Changing tne names in the
%    code will produce backwards compatibility issues, however, so we have
%    done our best to comment and explain here.
%
%    obj.unitDensity is the absorbance spectrum, normalized to a peak value
%    of 1. It is called unitDensity for historical reasons.  The
%    normalization to peak of 1 is just a convention, the quantity that
%    matters is the product obj.density*ojb.unitDensity.  Note that in
%    other similar routines (e.g., Lens), we do not normalize the
%    obj.unitDensity to a peak of 1.
%
%    obj.density is the peak optical density (sometimes just called optical
%    density). The interpretation as peak optical density depends on the
%    convention followed here of normlizing obj.unitDensity to a peak of 1.
%    One estimate of the average (across observers) peak density ise 0.28,
%    with a range of 0.17 to 0.48. Our default is 0.35, matching that of
%    the underlying data file from CVRL.
%
%    obj.absorptance is the absorptance spectrum.
%
%    obj.transmittance is the transmission spectrum.
%
%    The absorbance data that drive this routine are stored on wavelength
%    support in property wave_ in property unitDensity_.  Typically this is
%    set to a large wavelength support and then interpolated onto the
%    support in propety wave.  You can set unitDensity_ after the object is
%    instantiated, but you can't change wave_.  When you set unitDensity,
%    it should be on wavelength support wave, and it is splined onto
%    the wavelength support in wave_ before being stored in unitDensity_.
%    Note that this design does not prevent you from setting unitDensity on
%    wavelength support very different from that being used to store the
%    data, which could lead to extrapolation errors.  To avoid this, if you
%    want to use custom data, you may be better off creating the object
%    with the desired data on the wavelength support you intend to use.
%    That said, the default values are read in and stored on wave_ support
%    of 390:830 at 1 nm spacing, which is good for most applications.
%
%    Useful formulae:
%       Absorbance spectra are normalized to a peak value of 1. In this
%       routine, for historical reasons, absorbance is called unitDensity.
%
%       Absorptance spectra are the proportion of quanta actually absorbed.
%       This is the term used in this routine.
%       
%       Equation: absorptance = 1 - 10.^(-opticalDensity * absorbance).  In
%       this routine, again for historical reasons, opticalDensity is just
%       called density.  In the literature, this is sometimes called peak
%       optical density.
%
%       Transmittance is 1-absorptance, the amount of light that passes
%       through the pigment.  Alternately, you can compute
%       transmittance = 10.^(-opticalDensity * absorbance) and
%       absorptance as = 1-transmittance.
%
%    The default macular density absorbance was obtained from an old Stockman
%    site, but should match that at the new Stockman site (cvrl.org) and
%    those in the Psychtoolbox.
%
%    Macular pigment peak optical density varies across the retina. Use the
%    eccDensity method to obtain peak optical density across the human
%    retina.
%
% Inputs:
%    None.
%
% Outputs:
%    obj - The created macular pigment object
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    name        - String. The object name. Default 'human macular'.
%    wave        - Vector. The wavelength support of returned functions.
%                  Default (400:10:700).
%    density     - Numeric. The peak optical density. Default 0.35. 
%    unitDensity - Vector. Underlying stored absorbance.  Should be normalized
%                  to a maximum of 1. Default is read in from ISETBio file
%                  macularPigment.mat, and normalized to max of 1. This
%                  combined with the default value for density leads to
%                  standard estimates. If this is passed, it should be on
%                  the same wavelength support as the wave (not wave_)
%                  property. If you set this when object is instantiated,
%                  the wave_ property is set to wave.
