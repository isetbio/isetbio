function meanRate = coneMeanIsomerizations(cMosaic, varargin)
% Calculate spatial mean photon rate(R*/sec) for the 3 cone types in mosaic
% 
% Syntax:
%   meanRate = coneMeanIsomerizations(cMosaic);
%
% Description:
%    Calculate the spatial mean photon rate (R*/sec by default) for the 3
%    cone types in a mosaic.
%
%    Examples are contained in the code. To access, type 'edit
%    coneMeanIsomerizations.m' into the Command Window.
%
% Inputs:
%    cMosaic                  - coneMosaic object
%
% Outputs:
%    meanRate                 - Three vector absorption rates for the L, M, 
%                               and S cones in R*/sec.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    'perSample'              - Boolean. Normally the returned rate is mean
%                               per sec. Setting 'perSample' to true  makes
%                               the mean rate per temporal sample bins
%                               (default false)
%
%    'absorptionssInXWFormat' - Matrix. If empty (default), works on
%                               absorptions in cMosaic.absorptions. If this
%                               is passed, it acts on what is passed as
%                               this parameter, which is taken to be the
%                               absorptions in XW format. See RGB2XWFormat
%                               for a description of XW format.
%
% Notes:
%    * [NOTE: DHB - I can't figure out just from the code here whether this
%      can act on a time sequence or works just one frame at at time. There
%      is a key comment that says "Reshape from 3D (x, y, t) to space x
%      nCones" that is very confusing, because by the description time on
%      the left has turned into cones on the right. This comment needs to
%      be expanded/ fixed and then this description needs to make clear
%      whether or not a time sequence is involved in the input and output,
%      both for the normal case and for when the absorptions are passed in
%      as a parameter via the keyword absorptionsInXWFormat.]
%
%    * [NOTE: DHB - There is a comment, "Compute means for given
%      integration time", in the code below. I am not sure what this means.
%      I think it means, that we are computing the spatial mean for the
%      numbers in the mosaic, which in turn correspond to a particular
%      integration time. But the comment as written is confusing to me,
%      because I am tempted to interpret it as meaning that an integration
%      time could be passed to this routine, which I don't think it can.
%      Not changing comment because I'm not sure I fully understand what
%      the code is doing.]
