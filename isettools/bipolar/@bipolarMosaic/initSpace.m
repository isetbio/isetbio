function initSpace(obj, varargin)
% Syntax:
%
%   @bipolarMosaic.initSpace(varargin)
%
% Description:
%    Each bipolar mosaic takes its input from the cone mosaic, so that cell
%    locations are with respect to the spatial samples of the cone mosaic.
%    To compute the  spatial spread, we need to account for the cone
%    spacing. Thus, if the cones are spaced, say 2 um, and the bipolar RF
%    spans 5 samples, the spatial extent will be 2*5 um. 
%
% Input:
%    eccentricity - ???
%    spread       - ???
%    spreadRatio  - ???
%    stride       - ???
%    ampCenter    - ???
%    ampSurround  - ???
%
% Notes:
%    * Parasol is synonymous with diffuse.
%    * TODO
%       - To compute the spread in microns from this specification, 
%         multiply the number of input samples by the spatial sample
%         separation of the cones in the mosaic (stored in the input slot).
%       - We will incorporate a function that changes the size of the
%         spread and support as a function of eccentricity. For now we just
%         put in some placeholder numbers. (Let's do better on this
%         explanation, BW).
%       - When the layer is deeper, however, we have to keep referring back
%         through multiple layers. This issue will be addressed in the
%         RGCLAYER, and then onward.
%       - We need to write simple utilities that convert from the spatial
%         units on the cone mosaic into spatial units on the retinal
%         surface (in um or mm). That will be first implemented in
%         bipolar.plot('mosaic'). But basically, to do this the units are
%         X*coneMosaic.patternSampleSize (we think). This doesn't deal with
%         the jittered cone mosaic yet, but kind of like this. (BW/JRG).

% We have implemented five types of bipolar receptive fields, one assigned
% to each of the big five RGC types. Each bipolar type has a preferential
% cone selection rule. The critical rule is **no S-cones for on/off
% parasol and on-midget**, as per the Chichilnisky primate data (Field and
% Chichilnisky, 2010, Nature).

%  "For midget bipolar cells, it is known that at retinal eccentricities up

%   Center/Surround gain ratio is about 1:1.3 (area under the curve)
%   Surround:Center diameter about 1:10 (Center:surround)
%   They seem to think that for ganglion cells the gain ratio is about
%   1:0.5 and the diameter ratio is between 1:2 and 1:5.
