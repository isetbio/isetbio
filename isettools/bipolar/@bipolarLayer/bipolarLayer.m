classdef bipolarLayer < cellLayer
    % Syntax:
    %   obj = bipolarLayer([conemosaicObject], params);    
    %
    % Description:
    %    Create an bipolarLayer object
    %
    %    This is a subclass of the general class 'cellLayer'.  It inherits
    %    the properties of that class, including slots for an input, fig,
    %    center, size, ...
    %
    %    The bipolarLayer class stores general properties of the bipolar
    %    layer patch and stores the bipolarMosaic objects in its mosaic
    %    property field. This object has a role that matches the rgcLayer
    %    object.
