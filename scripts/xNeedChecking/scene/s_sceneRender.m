%% s_sceneRender
% 
% Read in a multispectral scene and render it under different lights.

% D50.mat, D55.mat, D65.mat, D75.mat
% In the first part of this script, we use an arbitrary method for
% displaying the spectral data (map different wavelength bands into r, g
% and b)
%
% Another way to think of rendering is to calculate the xyz values for the
% spectral data. We do this by first calculating the radiance signal for
% the surfaces under daylight (think of this as color balancing) Then we
% calculate the xyz values and use an xyz to linear srgb final step should
% be to pass the linear rgb into a display gamma lut
